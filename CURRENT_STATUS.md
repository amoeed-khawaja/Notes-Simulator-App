# NotesSimmulator - Current Status & Fixes

## Overview

NotesSimmulator is a React Native app with a Flask backend for audio recording, transcription, and note management. The project has been significantly improved to handle various audio formats and transcription services with robust error handling.

## Recent Issues & Fixes

### 1. Temp File Cleanup Issue ‚úÖ FIXED

**Problem:** Temporary audio files were being deleted prematurely before transcription could use them, causing "file not found" errors.

**Root Cause:** The original code was cleaning up temp files in a `finally` block that executed before all transcription attempts were complete.

**Solution:**

- Implemented a `temp_files_to_cleanup` list to track all temporary files
- Moved cleanup to the very end of the request processing
- Added proper file existence verification before transcription
- Improved error handling for file operations

**Files Modified:**

- `app.py` - Complete restructuring of the `/transcribe-audio` endpoint

### 2. Audio Conversion Issues ‚úÖ IMPROVED

**Problem:** Audio conversion was failing due to missing FFmpeg, causing transcription to fail for M4A files.

**Root Cause:** `pydub` requires FFmpeg to handle M4A files, but FFmpeg wasn't installed on the system.

**Solution:**

- Enhanced error handling in `convert_audio_format()` function
- Added file existence and size verification
- Improved fallback logic when conversion fails
- Created `install_ffmpeg.py` helper script for Windows users
- Updated README with FFmpeg installation instructions

**Files Modified:**

- `app.py` - Enhanced `convert_audio_format()` function
- `install_ffmpeg.py` - New helper script
- `README.md` - Added FFmpeg installation instructions

### 3. Transcription Service Fallback ‚úÖ IMPROVED

**Problem:** When one transcription service failed, the system didn't gracefully fall back to alternatives.

**Solution:**

- Implemented cascading fallback: OpenAI Whisper ‚Üí SpeechBrain ‚Üí Google Speech Recognition
- Added proper error handling for each service
- Improved logging to track which service is being used
- Added service verification before attempting transcription

## Current Architecture

### Backend (Flask)

**Transcription Services (in order of preference):**

1. **OpenAI Whisper** (via Replicate API) - Best accuracy, requires API key
2. **SpeechBrain** (local ASR model) - Works offline, good accuracy
3. **Google Speech Recognition** - Fallback option, requires internet

**Audio Processing:**

- Supports M4A, WAV, and other formats
- Automatic conversion to WAV for optimal transcription
- Graceful fallback when conversion fails

**File Management:**

- Temporary files are properly tracked and cleaned up
- File existence verification before processing
- Comprehensive error handling and logging

### Frontend (React Native)

**Audio Recording:**

- Records in M4A format (iOS) or WAV format (Android)
- Automatic playback through loudspeaker
- Proper error handling for recording issues

**Transcription:**

- Sends audio to Flask backend for processing
- Displays transcription results with word/character counts
- Allows users to choose transcription service

**Note Management:**

- Save, edit, and delete transcriptions
- Session-based organization
- File-based storage with timestamps

## Setup Requirements

### Backend Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### FFmpeg Installation (Required for M4A support)

```bash
# Windows
python install_ffmpeg.py

# macOS
brew install ffmpeg

# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt install ffmpeg
```

### API Keys

- **Replicate API Token** (for OpenAI Whisper): Set `REPLICATE_API_TOKEN` environment variable
- See `REPLICATE_SETUP.md` for detailed instructions

## Current Status

### ‚úÖ Working Features

- Audio recording and playback
- Multiple transcription services with fallback
- Proper temp file management
- Error handling and logging
- Note management and storage
- Cross-platform compatibility

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitations

- FFmpeg required for M4A audio conversion
- Internet connection needed for cloud transcription services
- SpeechBrain models require initial download (~1GB)

### üîß Recent Improvements

- Robust file handling and cleanup
- Enhanced error messages and logging
- Better fallback mechanisms
- Improved audio conversion reliability
- Comprehensive setup documentation

## Testing

### Backend Tests

```bash
python test_flask_fixes.py
python test_simple_speechbrain.py
```

### Frontend Tests

```bash
cd NotesSimmulator
npm test
```

## Next Steps

1. **User Testing:** Test the improved file handling with various audio formats
2. **Performance Optimization:** Consider caching for frequently used audio files
3. **UI Improvements:** Add progress indicators for transcription
4. **Error Recovery:** Implement retry mechanisms for failed transcriptions

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Couldn't find ffprobe or avprobe"**

   - Install FFmpeg using the provided instructions
   - Restart terminal/command prompt after installation

2. **"File not found" errors**

   - The temp file cleanup issue has been fixed
   - Check that audio files are being created properly

3. **Transcription failures**
   - Verify API keys are set correctly
   - Check internet connectivity for cloud services
   - Ensure audio quality is good (clear speech, minimal noise)

### Debug Information

The Flask server provides comprehensive logging:

- File creation and cleanup operations
- Transcription service selection and results
- Error details and fallback attempts

Check the console output for detailed debugging information.

## Conclusion

The NotesSimmulator project has been significantly improved with robust error handling, proper file management, and comprehensive fallback mechanisms. The temp file cleanup issue has been resolved, and the system now gracefully handles audio conversion failures. Users should install FFmpeg for optimal M4A support, but the system will work with other audio formats even without FFmpeg.
